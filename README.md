  ## Description
  This project was completed to allow a user to easily produce a team profile.  The profile takes inputs from the user, getting the employees' information and their roles on the team.  The project does this using Node.js and inquirer.  The project was tested using jest.

  ## Installation
  To install the needed dependencies, the user needs to clone the repository, then open it.  Using the terminal, the user needs to change directory into the Develop folder and run the command npm install.  Once the dependencies are installed, the user can run the program using the command, node app.js.  The user is then presented with a series of prompts for the Manager.  Upon completing the Manager prompts, the user is asked if they would like to add another employee.  The user can select to add an Engineer, Intern, or select that the profile is complete.  If Engineer or Intern are selected, the user is prompted for specific information pertaining to those roles.  If "Completed" is selected, the prompts will end and the employee information will be written to the "team.html" file in the "output" folder.
